---------------------------------------------------------------------
What is this?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This package provides a print filter for printing to EPSON AL-C1100
printers on Linux systems.

When using LPRng as the spooler software, this package is sufficient
to print.  However, if you want to use CUPS, you should also install
the CUPS related package (available from the same site you got this).

For this package to work correctly, the following has to be installed
and functional:

  ghostscript
  psutils
  glibc
  sed
  grep
  gawk
  bc


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The commands below require 'root' permissions and have been verified
on a Red Hat 9 system with LPRng.  For other Red Hat versions and
distributions you may have to adjust slightly.

  (1) Installing from RPM

  Simply executing the 'rpm' command below installs the software.

    # rpm -U Epson-ALC1100-filter-1.2-0.i386.rpm

  Modify the package's file name to match what you downloaded.

  (2) Post-installation settings

  Add a printer definition to your /etc/printcap.local.
  For an AL-C1100 on the USB port (/dev/usb/lp0) by the name of
  'alc1100', that would look as follows:

    alc1100:\
                :ml#0:\
                :mx#0:\
                :sd=/var/spool/lpd/alc1100:\
                :if=/usr/bin/alc1100_lprwrapper.sh:\
                :sh:\
                :lp=/dev/usb/lp0:

  (3) Restart lpd

  To make these changes take effect you have to restart lpd.  On most
  distributions you can do that with:

    # /etc/init.d/lpd restart

  This completes the addition of your printer.

  (4) Setting print options with LPRng

  Print options can be set in the /etc/epkowa/alc1100/option.conf
  file.  This file contains just plain text and can be modified
  with your favorite text editor (vi, emacs, etc.).  You will
  need "root" permissions to do so.

  File format:
  * all lines starting with a # are considered comments and ignored
  * sections run from one "# *Section" marker to the next
  * every line contains one setting in a "key=value" format
  * sections marked with "*Must*" require at least one valid line
  * sections may be separated by at most one non-comment line

  Note: if otherwise unsupported combinations of settings arise,
  printing results may not be what you would expect.

  Example: specifying duplex printing
        # *Section Duplex     : default=None
        # Duplex=None
          Duplex=DuplexNoTumble
        # Duplex=DuplexTumble
        #
  Here, the setting "Duplex=DuplexNoTumble" will be used.

  For more information on the keys and values, please refer to the
  list below.

Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* When used with CUPS, please refer to the README of the CUPS related
  package (Epson-ALC1100-filter-cups).

* The filter included can only handle PostScript data.

* We suggest you set print options via the option.conf file.
  Although you can set them on the lpr command line, setting something
  like the paper size quickly becomes quite a bore.

  For 600dpi monochrome duplex printing of foo.ps on 'alc1100':

  $ lpr -P alc1100 -ZDuplex=DuplexNoTumble,Resolution=600dpi,Color=black foo.ps

  To print the same file on B5 sized paper:

  $ lpr -P alc1100 -ZPageSize=b5 foo.ps

  See the lpr help (lpr --help) for details of command line options
  and how they should be specified.

* When printing several copies of a multipage document with lpr or lp,
  the "Collate" option can be used to toggle the page sorting order.

  - three copies, sort pages in 1,2,...,1,2,...,1,2,... order
    $ lpr -P alc1100 -K3 foo.ps

  - three copies, sort pages in 1,1,1,2,2,2,... order
    $ lpr -P alc1100 -ZCopies=3 foo.ps

* After cancelling a print job, the next print job may not give the
  desired result.

* Please refer to your printer manual for details on the various
  combinations of settings and their limitations.

* Optional hardware settings can be set even if such hardware is not
  currently installed.  Naturally, the result will not be what you
  expected.  Please refrain from using such settings when optional
  hardware is not installed.

  Furthermore, specifying combinations of settings that are not
  supported according to your printer's specifications may lead to
  paper jams and can possibly cause mechanical damage.

* Occasionally, part of your PostScript data may not fit on the paper
  size you selected or be oriented the same way as the paper in your
  tray.
