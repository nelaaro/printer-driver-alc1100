What is this?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This package includes the PPD file needed by the Linux print filter
for printing to EPSON AL-C1100 printers on systems that use the Common
UNIX Printing System (CUPS) as their printing system.

For this package to work correctly, the following has to be installed
and functional:

  Epson-ALC1100-filter	version 1.2
  cups			version 1.1.17 or later
  foomatic		version 3 or later

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The commands below require 'root' permissions and have been verified
on a Fedora Core 2 system.  For other versions and distributions you
may have to adjust slightly.

  (1) Installing from RPM

  Simply executing the 'rpm' command below installs the software.

    # rpm -U Epson-ALC1100-filter-cups-1.2-0.i386.rpm

  Modify the package's file name to match what you downloaded.

  (2) Restarting CUPS

  To make these changes take effect you have to restart CUPS.  On most
  distributions you can do that with:

    # /etc/init.d/cups restart

  (3) Adding a printer

  You can add a printer from the command line with 'lpadmin'.  For
  details on this command, see the lpadmin(8).
  To add an AL-C1100 printer connected to the first USB port by
  the name of alc1100, you would use:

    # lpadmin -p alc1100 -E -v usb:/dev/usb/lp0 -m Epson-AL-C1100-fm3.ppd

  You can also add a printer via the CUPS web tool from your browser.
  This is explained in detail in the CUPS manual.
  For a CUPS server running on your local PC, you can access this tool
  at:

    http://localhost:631/

  Once you have access to the web tool, you

    1) select "Manage Printers"
    2) select "Add Printer"
       You will be asked for the account and password of the printer
       administrator.  If you have done nothing special to set these
       up, you can use "root" for the account and the root password.
    3) enter a "Name" and select "Continue"
       The other fields can be defaulted.
    4) select the connected printer "Device" and "Continue"
    5) enter "Epson" for the "Make" and "Continue"
    6) select the printer "Model" you have and "Continue"
       For example, for an AL-C1100 you would select "EPSON AL-C1100,
       ESC/PageS Filter (en)".

  This completes the addition of your printer.

For information about how to print or set print options, please refer
to the CUPS documentation.  Alternatively, you can refer to the README
included with the Epson-ALC1100-filter package.

Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* When printing several copies of a multipage document with lpr or lp,
  the "Collate" option can be used to toggle the page sorting order.

  - three copies, sort pages in 1,2,...,1,2,...,1,2,... order
    $ lpr -P alc1100 -o Copies=3 -o Collate=on file.ps

  - three copies, sort pages in 1,1,1,2,2,2,... order
    $ lpr -P alc1100 -o Copies=3 -o Collate=off file.ps

* Using "Collate=on" in combination with double sided and/or n-up
  printing may not give the expected result.

* After cancelling a print job, the next print job may not give the
  desired result.

* Please refer to your printer manual for details on the various
  combinations of settings and their limitations.

* Optional hardware settings can be set even if such hardware is not
  currently installed.  Naturally, the result will not be what you
  expected.  Please refrain from using such settings when optional
  hardware is not installed.

  Furthermore, specifying combinations of settings that are not
  supported according to your printer's specifications may lead to
  paper jams and can possibly cause mechanical damage.
